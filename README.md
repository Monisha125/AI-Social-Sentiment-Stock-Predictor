# Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis and Machine Learning

## Description
This project predicts stock prices using historical data and sentiment analysis. It utilizes financial data from Yahoo Finance and analyzes social sentiment (simulated here but extendable with real data from platforms like Twitter). The prediction model employs linear regression.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The dependencies include:
   - pandas
   - yfinance
   - textblob
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn

## Usage
To run the project, use:
```python
python your_script_name.py
```
### Example
```python
symbol = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2023-01-01'
end_date = '2023-12-31'
predict_stock_price(symbol, start_date, end_date)
```
The program will print the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the predicted stock price for the next day.

## Features
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment using TextBlob (simulated data provided).
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses linear regression for stock price prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculates the Mean Squared Error of the model.

## Data Sources
- **Stock Data**: Retrieved using the `yfinance` package.
- **Sentiment Data**: Simulated data, but can be replaced with real data from a social media API like Twitter.

## Model
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `yfinance` for fetching stock data
  - `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation
